https://w3c.github.io/webappsec-referrer-policy/#referrer-policy-delivery
specifies the following delivery methods:
* Referrer-Policy header
* <meta name="referrer">
* referrerpolicy attribute on <a>, <area>, <img>, <iframe>, <link>
* inheritance (for things like local/guid schemes)

But there's also the CSP 1.1 spec-ish thing that included a referrer directive:
